* 4 spaces for indentation
* camelCase for variables/functions/constants
* PascalCase for class names/unions/structs
* Prefer verbosity over abbreviations when naming variables
* Use `/* */` for multiline comments, and be generous with comments!
* Braces should start on the same line as the keyword
